\section{Project Overview}
The outcome of this project is a Clinic software product that is used to assist patients in booking appointments effortlessly. This software collects data about the patients and their medical history, which helps the Doctor to get a better view of the Patients' case and view their medical history easily any time necessary. Therefore, offering accurate Diagnosis in less time and with less confusion. Moreover, this product shall offer better communication with the Dr and his Patients. The Doctor can write reports for his patients and keep them updated. On the other hand, Patients also have the ability to reach out to the Doctor's assistant using a chatting system, learning more about their case and the operations scheduled, if any.
\subsection{Project Scope}
The project's target is to help Patients book appointments and assist the Dr to view his patients' data effortlessly. This target shall be reached using certain methods. These methods include offering the patient an easy way to fill his information and book his appointments in any time suitable for him without reaching out to receptionists. On the other hand, the receptionists shall be automatically notified when a patient books an appointment. Moreover the patients' data, including their medical history, shall be saved for the Dr to view easily any time. API tools shall also be used to offer a chatting system for the Patients and the Doctor's assistant to communicate. By successfully building these methods and making them function well, there shall be no more confusion with retrieving Patients' data and booking appointments. The patients and the Dr shall be updated with any new progress shortly and effortlessly.
\subsection{Goals and objectives}
\begin{enumerate}
\item  The Patients shall be able to book appointments effortlessly.


\item Receptionists and the Doctor shall be able to view appointments.


\item The Patients shall be able to contact the Doctor's assistant through a chatting system.


\item The Doctor shall be able to view Patients' medical history.


\item The Doctor shall be able to add Reports concerning his Patients' cases.


\item The Doctor shall be able to add an operation.


\item The Doctor's assistant shall be able to schedule operations and contact patients.

\item The admin shall be able to add staff, view appointments and manage everything concerning the system.

\item The Patients shall be able to register into the system.

\item The Patients and The Staff shall be able to login into the system, if verified, and shall be forwarded to their main pages.


\end{enumerate}

\subsection {Project Timeline}
The overall time frame and major phases (milestones) along with deliverable for each phase.

\section{ Context viewpoint}
Provide a description of Systems services and users. 
You can provide use case diagram and context diagram here.

\section{System Architecture Design} \label{s-arch}

\begin{figure}[tbh]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.7\linewidth]{./image}
\caption{Architectural Design}
\label{archdsgn}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Logical viewpoint} \label{ss-logical}
Write a  high level overview  of how responsibilities of the system were partitioned and then assigned to subsystems. Identify each high level subsystem and  the  roles or responsibilities assigned to it. 
Describe  how  the subsystems collaborate with each other in order to achieve the desired functionality. Don t go into too much detail about the individual subsystems. The main purpose is to gain a general understanding  of how  and why the system was decomposed, and  how the  individual parts work together. Provide a diagram showing the major subsystems and data repositories and their interconnections. Describe the diagram if required.

The purpose of the Logical viewpoint is to elaborate existing and designed types and their implementations as classes and interfaces with their structural static relationships. 
provide detailed description of your used architecture here such as MVC, layered architecture. use figures such as in figure \ref{archdsgn}etc.
\subsubsection{Design Rationale}
Discuss the rationale for selecting the architecture described in section \ref{ss-logical} including critical issues
and  trade/offs that were  considered. You  may discuss other  architectures that were 
considered, provided that you explain why you didn't choose them.

\subsection{Patterns use viewpoint}
This viewpoint addresses design ideas focusing on the used design patterns. 
UML class diagram and the UML package diagram can be used here to illustrate the used design patterns.\\
\subsubsection{Design Rationale}
You need to provide the design rationale for using these design patterns.

\subsection{Composition viewpoint}
Provide a decomposition of the subsystems in the architectural design. Supplement with text 
as needed. 
provide subsystem model, package diagrams, generalization hierarchy diagram(s) (if any), aggregation hierarchy diagram(s) (if any).

\subsection{Structure viewpoint}\label{Structure}
The Structure viewpoint is used to document the internal organization of the system.
Provide here a detailed UML class diagram of the system.

\subsection{Algorithm viewpoint}
In this section, provide closer look at what each component does in a more systematic way. If you gave a functional description in section \ref{Structure}, provide a summary of your algorithm for each function listed in\ref{Structure} in procedural description language (PDL) or pseudo-code. If you gave an OO description, summarize each object member function for all the objects listed in \ref{Structure}.\\
Decision tables and flowcharts; program design languages (PDL), “pseudo-code,” and (actual) programming languages may also be used. 

\subsection{Interaction viewpoint}
Provides description of Object communication, messaging using UML sequence diagrams


\subsection{Interface viewpoint}
The Interface viewpoint provides programmers, and testers the means to know how
to correctly use the provided services. 
This viewpoint consists of a set of interface specifications for each entity. \\
NOTE—User interfaces are addressed separately. 

\section{Data Design}
\subsection{Data Description}
Explain how the information domain of your system is transformed into data structures. Describe how the major data or system entities are stored, processed and organized. \\
You may consider the answer for the following questions:\\
What is the original format of the data (paper based, excel files, old system database)?\\
Identify the method used to capture the data into your system(web page forms, import documents etc..)?\\
How large is the database expected to be (in numbers of rows and columns for the main entities)?\\
What is the expected number of users/customers for the system?\\
How is your entity keys(ids) constructed (is there a specific code or format for ID definition)?
Does your data contain date/time, if yes which format are they presented in?
You may provide data models such as Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) in this section.

\subsection{Database design description}
Describe any databases (provide database schema diagram) and/or description of other data storage items.

\section{Human Interface Design}

\subsection {User Interface}
Describe the functionality of the system from the user s perspective. Explain  how the user 
will be  able  to use  your system to complete  all the  expected  features and  the  feedback 
information that will be displayed for the user.

\subsection {Screen Images}
Display screenshots showing the interface from the user s perspective. These can be  hand drawn
or you can use an automated drawing tool. Just make them as accurate as possible.
(Graph paper works well .)



\section{Requirements Matrix}
Provide a cross reference that traces components and data structures to the requirements in your SRS document.
Use  a  tabular  format to show  which system  components satisfy each of the  functional 
requirements from the SRS. Refer to the functional requirements by the numbers/codes that you gave them in the SRS.


\section{APPENDICES}
This section is optional.
Appendices may be included, either directly or by reference, to provide supporting details that could 
aid in the understanding of the Software Design Document.
