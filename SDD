\section{Project Overview}
The outcome of this project is a Clinic software product that is used to assist patients in booking appointments effortlessly. This software collects data about the patients and their medical history, which helps the Doctor to get a better view of the Patients' case and view their medical history easily any time necessary. Therefore, offering accurate Diagnosis in less time and with less confusion. Moreover, this product shall offer better communication with the Dr and his Patients. The Doctor can write reports for his patients and keep them updated. On the other hand, Patients also have the ability to reach out to the Doctor's assistant using a chatting system, learning more about their case and the operations scheduled, if any.
\subsection{Project Scope}
The project's target is to help Patients book appointments and assist the Dr to view his patients' data effortlessly. This target shall be reached using certain methods. These methods include offering the patient an easy way to fill his information and book his appointments in any time suitable for him without reaching out to receptionists. On the other hand, the receptionists shall be automatically notified when a patient books an appointment. Moreover the patients' data, including their medical history, shall be saved for the Dr to view easily any time. API tools shall also be used to offer a chatting system for the Patients and the Doctor's assistant to communicate. By successfully building these methods and making them function well, there shall be no more confusion with retrieving Patients' data and booking appointments. The patients and the Dr shall be updated with any new progress shortly and effortlessly.
\subsection{Goals and objectives}
\begin{enumerate}
\item  The Patients shall be able to book appointments effortlessly.


\item Receptionists and the Doctor shall be able to view appointments.


\item The Patients shall be able to contact the Doctor's assistant through a chatting system.


\item The Doctor shall be able to view Patients' medical history.


\item The Doctor shall be able to add Reports concerning his Patients' cases.

\section{System Architecture Design} \label{s-arch}

\begin{figure}[tbh]

\caption{Architectural Design}
\label{archdsgn}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Logical viewpoint} \label{ss-logical}
Write a  high level overview  of how responsibilities of the system were partitioned and then assigned to subsystems. Identify each high level subsystem and  the  roles or responsibilities assigned to it. 
Describe  how  the subsystems collaborate with each other in order to achieve the desired functionality. Don t go into too much detail about the individual subsystems. The main purpose is to gain a general understanding  of how  and why the system was decomposed, and  how the  individual parts work together. Provide a diagram showing the major subsystems and data repositories and their interconnections. Describe the diagram if required.

The purpose of the Logical viewpoint is to elaborate existing and designed types and their implementations as classes and interfaces with their structural static relationships. 
provide detailed description of your used architecture here such as MVC, layered architecture. use figures such as in figure \ref{archdsgn}etc.
\subsubsection{Design Rationale}
Discuss the rationale for selecting the architecture described in section \ref{ss-logical} including critical issues
and  trade/offs that were  considered. You  may discuss other  architectures that were 
considered, provided that you explain why you didn't choose them.
\subsection{Patterns use viewpoint}
\subsubsection{MVC design pattern}
Clinic management system is build on MVC form. MVC is the separation of Model, View and Controller classes. Main advantage of MVC architecture is differentiating the layers of a project in Model,View and Controller for the Re-usability of code and better maintenance. MVC is applied in most of  the tables in out project.
  Examples:
  \begin{itemize}
      \item Appointment
      \item Reports
      \item patients system
      \item Notification system
      
  \end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Singleton Design Pattern}
Singleton design pattern is used to allow access to one and only one instance of a particular class. It provide global access the that single instance from anywhere. In our project we used singleton in connection to the database class which is the database helper class, so a single connection is made to the database by each user.

\subsubsection{Observer Design Pattern}
The Observer Design Pattern is used in the application for the notifications feature due to that we notify in different formats emails and SMS.

\subsubsection{Decorator Design Pattern}
The Decorator Design Pattern allow us to attach additional responsibilities to an object dynamically. Decorators provide a flexible alternative to sub-classing for extending functionality. We will use decorative in preparing the invoice outcome. As invoice depends on the patient's chooses, invoice will be out in different formats.

\subsubsection{Facade Design Pattern}
Facade pattern creates an easy use interface by hiding multiple interfaces in one class. we will use facade on all APIs used to hide the complexity of the code.


\subsection{Composition viewpoint}
Provide a decomposition of the subsystems in the architectural design. Supplement with text 
as needed. 
provide subsystem model, package diagrams, generalization hierarchy diagram(s) (if any), aggregation hierarchy diagram(s) (if any).

\subsection{Structure viewpoint}\label{Structure}
\subsubsection{Class diagram}
\begin{itemize}
    \item  CRUD interface: This will contain the functions which draws the Forms and tables to contain the data of the users for viewing,searching,inserting, deleting and editing.
    \item Login: In this part the files are meant to make the validations and verification on all the data inserted for protection and insurance during login.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Interaction viewpoint}


The following sequence diagrams shows briefly the actions taken to finish any process in our application. The sequence diagrams helps to depicts interaction between objects in a sequential order in each process on our system.

\subsubsection{Admin Module}

\subsection{Algorithm viewpoint}
In this section, provide closer look at what each component does in a more systematic way. If you gave a functional description in section \ref{Structure}, provide a summary of your algorithm for each function listed in\ref{Structure} in procedural description language (PDL) or pseudo-code. If you gave an OO description, summarize each object member function for all the objects listed in \ref{Structure}.\\
Decision tables and flowcharts; program design languages (PDL), “pseudo-code,” and (actual) programming languages may also be used. 

\subsection{Interaction viewpoint}
Provides description of Object communication, messaging using UML sequence diagrams


\subsection{Interface viewpoint}
The Interface viewpoint provides programmers, and testers the means to know how
to correctly use the provided services. 
This viewpoint consists of a set of interface specifications for each entity. \\
NOTE—User interfaces are addressed separately. 

\section{Data Design}
\subsection{Data Dictionary}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Rtb option user type: the relation between the options the user types which is mainly the staff as Admin,doctor,assistant,receptionist.
  \item Rtb  Payment : the table that contains the relations between the Payment Method ID and the description, where it saves the options ID required to be shown when selecting any kind of payment according to the appointment type.
  \item Rtb appointments:the relation between the clinic ID from class clinics that is chosen and the patient's specific time slot that is booked.
  \item Rtb patient's history: the relation between the patients and the doctor as the doctor is allowed to view every patients history to precisely wrote the report needed for this specific case.
  
  \item Tb clinics :stores the description and the id of each clinic branch.
  \item Tb option payment values: the table that carries the values that each user has paid by a certain payment method.
  \item Tb injections:saves the description and the price of the injection the doctor recommended to the patient.
  \item Tb appointments: the appointments that happened and its amount and category each appointment also stores the day and the patient's id.
  \item Tb day limit: that table that stores the day of appointments and the maximum limit of appointments for that specific day because it is dynamic and depends on the type of appointment that is reserved. 
  \item Tb  staff: the email and hashed password for each user signed up on the system and his/her own profile details.
  \item tb patients: storing the data of the patients while registering into the system.
  \item 
  \item Rtb operations: the table that contains the relation between the patient and the assistant that the assistant has the ability to add operations if needed to this specific patient.
  \item Rtb operations type:the table that contains the relation between reports and operations that knows from tb reports if the doctor added an operation to this patient or not.
  \item Rtb reports: the table that contains relation between the patient and the doctor as the doctor has the ability to generate a report to each patient with specific description according to his/her illness.
  \item Tb reports: stores the date the report generated at, comments and the patient's ID.
  \item Tb message: the email subject and content that system can send to clients.
  \item Tb message type: determine either the message is via mail or SMS. 
  \item Tb user type: all the staff types on the system and their IDs.
  

\end{itemize}

\section{Human Interface Design}

\subsection {User Interface}
Describe the functionality of the system from the user s perspective. Explain  how the user 
will be  able  to use  your system to complete  all the  expected  features and  the  feedback 
information that will be displayed for the user.

\subsection {Screen Images}
Display screenshots showing the interface from the user s perspective. These can be  hand drawn
or you can use an automated drawing tool. Just make them as accurate as possible.
(Graph paper works well .)



\section{Requirements Matrix}
Provide a cross reference that traces components and data structures to the requirements in your SRS document.
Use  a  tabular  format to show  which system  components satisfy each of the  functional 
requirements from the SRS. Refer to the functional requirements by the numbers/codes that you gave them in the SRS.


\section{APPENDICES}
This section is optional.
Appendices may be included, either directly or by reference, to provide supporting details that could 
aid in the understanding of the Software Design Document.
